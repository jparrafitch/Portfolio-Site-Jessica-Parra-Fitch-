          "Design Objective:
Create a responsive web app that provides property buyers with information on properties of interest that is user-friendly and contains a database of available residential properties and land with comprehensive information on each listing. This web app is made primarily for new, small-scale property buyers who are looking to invest for additional income or financial security. These buyers may struggle to get started without professional guidance and waste time viewing properties out of their range. This web app will provide them with the expertise needed to get started efficiently.

User Stories:
As a user, I want to create a profile containing all my property criteria to get relevant results.
As a user, I want to be able to filter properties to find good matches based on my needs.
As a user, I want to be able to save or mark properties I am interested in to easily revisit them.
As a user, I want access to as much written and visual information as possible about properties Iâ€™m interested in, to make an informed decision.
As a user, I want to be able to contact the right people if I am interested in viewing a property, so that I schedule a viewing."
